Start reading the error messages from the last line. This last line tells you the type of error and what is the error. For example, if you run the following cell as it is, you will get a `SyntaxError` (look at the last line). Read what it tells you about that error. Then, if you read the error message from the beginning, you will find in which line the error occurred, in this case `line 5`. The error message will even try to tell you the exact position were the error is located, by copying the bugged line, and signalling the exact position with the symbol `^` underneath. These indications of the line and the exact location of the bug might not always be accurate (in fact, that is the case of this first error message), because the way the computer process the code is not exactly as we read it.
